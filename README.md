# Description

This project leverages Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy libraries to analyze and draw conslusions from Uber and Lyft data collected in Boston, MA between November and December 2018. The original dataset was published by the Kaggle user RaviMunde, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices). The process of importing and cleaning the dataset can be found in the [Data Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb) file, while the process of analyzing and visualizing the dataset can be found in the [Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Data%20Analysis.ipynb) file. A full analysis can be seen by viewing and downloading the [Project Conclusions.docx](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Project%20Conclusions.docx) file.

### [Data Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
Components of the data_cleaning.ipynb file include:
1. Importation of a ride-sharing data set ([cab_rides.csv](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Resources/Kaggle_Data/cab_rides.csv)) published by Kaggle user RaviMunde.
2. Use of the DatetimePy library to convert the 13-digit UNIX timestamp in order to determine the day of the week on which each data point was recovered.
3. Removal of extraneous columns not significant to the analysis.
4. Use of the DropNa function to remove about 60,000 columns missing essential data values.
5. Exportation of the cleaned data file for use in the analysis portion.

### [Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
Components of the data_analysis.ipynb file include:
1. Importation of cleaned data file ([cleaned_Kaggle_data.csv](https://github.com/blhawkins/theBostonLagers/blob/master/Resources/cleaned_Kaggle_data.csv)) created in the Data Cleaning.ipynb procedure.
2. Use of Pandas GroupBy, Matplotlib, and SciPy Linear Regression functionality to determine how ride distance and ride price compare accross the various ride sources and destinations.
